This is **Azalea**, a bot aimed to have all in one commands to avoid having a bunch of bots with similar functions inside a server.

Added a lot of languages.
## What does Azalea have to offer?
- Completly unlocked functionalities, there's no payment for functions in this bot.
- Completly open source, users can contribute to the bot and require changes as they please.
- Multiserver functionalities and per server functions/permissions.
- API (This would be available in a future).
- Completly legal, no scuffed stuff, as my own vision is being as transparent as I can with the project.
- You want to make your own thing? Feel free to grab the repository and modify it as you please.
- Always follow the TOS (Terms of Service) of discord up to date.

## I don't know how to use the bot

No worries! I've made a documentation just for you.

You're a developer? You're a user? We have them both!
